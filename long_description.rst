SkoolKit
========
SkoolKit is a collection of utilities that can be used to disassemble a
Spectrum_ game (or indeed any piece of Spectrum software written in machine
code) into a format known as a `skool` file. Then, from this `skool` file, you
can use SkoolKit to create a browsable disassembly in HTML format, or a
re-assemblable disassembly in assembly language. So the `skool` file is - from
start to finish as you develop it by organising and annotating the code - the
common 'source' for both the reader-friendly HTML version of the disassembly,
and the developer- and assembler-friendly version of the disassembly.

Features
--------
With SkoolKit you can:

* use sna2ctl.py_ to generate a `control file`_ (an attempt to identify
  routines and data blocks by static analysis) from a snapshot (SNA, SZX or
  Z80) or raw memory file
* enable sna2ctl.py_ to generate a much better control file that more reliably
  distinguishes code from data by using a code execution map produced by an
  emulator or rzxplay.py_
* use sna2skool.py_ along with this control file to produce a disassembly of a
  snapshot or raw memory file
* add annotations to this disassembly (or the control file) as you discover the
  purpose of each routine and data block
* use skool2html.py_ to convert a disassembly into a bunch of HTML files (with
  annotations in place, and the operands of CALL and JP instructions converted
  into hyperlinks)
* use skool2asm.py_ to convert a disassembly into an assembler source file
  (also with annotations in place)
* use skool2ctl.py_ to convert a disassembly back into a control file (with
  annotations retained)
* use skool2bin.py_ to convert a disassembly into a raw memory file
* use tap2sna.py_ to convert a TAP or TZX file into a 'pristine' Z80 or SZX
  snapshot
* use snapinfo.py_ to analyse a snapshot or raw memory file and list the BASIC
  program it contains, show register values, produce a call graph, find tile
  graphic data, find text, or find sequences of arbitrary byte values
* use trace.py_ to trace the execution of machine code in a snapshot or raw
  memory file
* use rzxplay.py_ to trace the execution of machine code in an RZX file, and
  produce a code execution map for sna2ctl.py_
* use tapinfo.py_ to analyse the blocks in a TAP or TZX file, and list the
  BASIC program it contains
* use rzxinfo.py_ to analyse the blocks in an RZX file, and extract snapshots
  from it
* use bin2tap.py_ to convert a snapshot or raw memory file into a TAP file
* use bin2sna.py_ to convert a raw memory file into a Z80 or SZX snapshot
* use snapmod.py_ to modify the register values or memory contents in a Z80 or
  SZX snapshot
* use sna2img.py_ to convert graphic data in a disassembly, SCR file, snapshot
  or raw memory file into a PNG image

In an HTML disassembly produced by skool2html.py_ you can also:

* use the `image macros`_ to build still and animated PNG images from graphic
  data
* use the `#AUDIO`_ macro to build WAV files for sound effects and tunes
* use the `#R`_ macro in annotations to create hyperlinks between routines and
  data blocks that refer to each other
* use `[Bug:*]`_, `[Fact:*]`_ and `[Poke:*]`_ sections in a ref file to neatly
  render lists of bugs, trivia and POKEs on separate pages

For a demonstration of SkoolKit's capabilities, take a look at the complete
disassemblies of `Skool Daze`_, `Back to Skool`_, `Contact Sam Cruise`_,
`Manic Miner`_, `Jet Set Willy`_ and `Hungry Horace`_.

Quick start guide
-----------------
SkoolKit includes fairly detailed documentation_, but if you want to get up and
running quickly, here goes.

To convert a SNA, Z80 or SZX snapshot of a Spectrum game into a `skool` file
(so that it can be converted into HTML or assembly language)::

  $ sna2skool.py game.z80 > game.skool

To split the disassembly up into code and data blocks, you'll need a
`control file`_.

To turn this `skool` file into an HTML disassembly::

  $ skool2html.py game.skool

To turn it into a file that can be fed to an assembler::

  $ skool2asm.py game.skool > game.asm
